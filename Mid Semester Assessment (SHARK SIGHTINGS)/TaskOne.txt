CLASS TaskTwo

MAIN

PRINT Greeting message
INITIALISE 4 arrays for sharks species (1 per)

ASK FOR/TAKE input from user for day 1-5 shark sightings
        FOR (i counter loop for < 5)
            TRY
                GET user input
                If >=0 then put at index[i] in shark's array
                Else give invalid input message
            CATCH
            InputMismatch exception
            Give invalid input (not an integer) message
        
    DO THIS LOOP FOR ALL SHARKS AND THEIR ARRAY INPUTS

AFTER ARRAY INFO IS DONE

MENU
PRINT out Menu messages options

EXAMPLE BELOW
Print menu out to terminal with 1,2,3,4,etc options
1. show avg for each shark over entire 5 day period
2. show shark that had the highest sightings value over the 5 days
3. show shark that had the lowest sightings value over the 5 days
4. show % breakdown of total sightings over 5 days per species
5. show the day (use "day" + index number +1) that had largest total sightings value
0. Exit

INITIALISE int menu variable  = 0
INITIALISE int choice variable =0
choice = scanner next integer input
WHILE menu = 0
TRY
If choice < 0 or > 5, show error message for please pick an option in the menu (1,2,3,4,5,0)

If choice = 1, do menu option 1 operation
    get all values for each sharks array, and average
    example print out - MAKO - Average Sightings = XX 

If choice = 2, do menu option 2 operation
    use max method to find max of each array
    then find highest by finding max of those 4 figures from each array

If choice = 3, do menu option 3 operation
    same as choice = 2, but using min method

If choice = 4, do menu option 4 operation
    sum array elements for each species, and for all species
    divide sum of each species by all species, display as %
    print message (example GREAT WHITE - XX%, MAKO - YY%, etc)

if choice = 5, do menu option 5 operation
    do same operation as for choice 2
    find array index that value was in, print out index + 1 for the day
    Example: if max value was in array index 3 (Day (index +1)) - Day 4

if choice = 0, do menu option 0 operation
    set menu to 1, exit while loop and end program

CATCH
For input mismatch
